## 2024-05-23 - [Client-Side API Payload Caching]
**Learning:** The application aggressively polls the MLB Stats API every 60 seconds. For historical data (like yesterday's schedule and completed game boxscores), these repeated calls are redundant and waste bandwidth/CPU, especially since they can trigger 7+ boxscore requests per poll. Concurrent requests in Promise.all for the same game cause duplicate network requests.
**Action:** Implemented `window.apiCache` to memoize Promises for endpoints where `g.status.abstractGameState` is 'Final' or 'Completed Early'. Caching the Promise itself resolves concurrent request duplication and ensures the cached data is correctly injected into the normal rendering pipeline.

## 2024-05-23 - [API Response Caching for Polled Schedules]
**Learning:** Polling static historical endpoints (like season trophies or yesterday's schedule) causes redundant network requests. Concurrent UI mapping loops for Live game endpoints can trigger duplicate in-flight requests if users share a game.
**Action:** Cached the static season trophy API call. Cached yesterday's schedule API call conditionally (only if all games are final). Added a short-lived `liveApiCache` per polling loop to deduplicate concurrent live boxscore requests. Always cache the Promise to handle concurrency.

## 2026-09-07 - [Reusing Cached Promises in Modals]
**Learning:** Background polling loops populate window.apiCache and window.liveApiCache with API request promises, and currentGames and yesterdayGames with hydrated API payloads (e.g., linescore). Making new network requests in user-triggered events (like modals) ignores these populated caches and duplicates network fetches.
**Action:** Reused the cached promises (e.g., window.apiCache[gamePk]) and hydrated objects (e.g., game.linescore from currentGames) in modal functions instead of making redundant fetch calls, falling back to fetch concurrently using Promise.all only on cache misses.

## 2024-05-23 - [Concurrent Independent API Requests]
**Learning:** Background polling loops (like `loadScores()`) that fetched multiple schedule endpoints (e.g., today's games and yesterday's games) were executing sequentially. Awaiting the first response and rendering its UI before initiating the check/fetch for the second response created an unnecessary network waterfall effect, inflating the overall loading time.
**Action:** Initialized all independent fetch promises concurrently (using variables or `Promise.all`) at the top of the function *before* awaiting any of them. This allows network requests to resolve in parallel while the UI continues to render.
